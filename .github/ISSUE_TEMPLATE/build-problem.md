Testing the build of Jep on the variety of possible platforms and environments
is difficult. It works well for Linux and OS X.  Building on Windows poses
unique challenges that have been documented on the [Windows wiki page](https://github.com/mrj0/jep/wiki/Windows).
If your environment has build problems please search for a solution and post
your results to the mailing list so it is documented for others with a similar
environment.
